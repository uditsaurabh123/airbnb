# ⭐ How to Add Touch Controls in Unity (Very Easy Tutorial for Beginners)

If you’re building a **mobile game in Unity**, one of the first features you’ll need is **touch controls**.  
Good news — it’s **super easy**, and in this article, I’ll show you the **fastest and cleanest** way to move a player using touch input.

Whether you're making a **2D platformer**, **top-down game**, or **mobile arcade**, this method works everywhere.

Let’s get started. 👇

---

## 🎮 Why Touch Controls Matter in Mobile Games

Touch input is the primary way players interact with mobile games.  
Without proper touch handling, your game will feel unresponsive or confusing.

This guide covers the essentials:

✔ Detecting touch input  
✔ Converting touch position to world space  
✔ Moving your player toward the touch  
✔ Writing clean, beginner-friendly C# code

Everything is done inside **Update()**, using Unity’s built-in `Input` system.

---

# 🟦 Step 1 — Detect Touch Input

Unity makes detecting touch simple:

```csharp
if (Input.touchCount > 0)
{
    Touch touch = Input.GetTouch(0);
}
```

### ✅ What this does:

* Checks if the screen is currently touched
    
* Gets the **first finger** touching the screen
    
* Perfect for single-touch movement systems
    

If the player touches the screen, the rest of the movement logic will run.

---

# 🟩 Step 2 — Convert Touch Position to World Space

Unity gives touch position in **screen space** (pixels).  
But your player is in **world space**, so we must convert it:

```csharp
Vector3 pos = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(touch.position);
pos.z = 0;
```

### Why set `pos.z = 0`?

Because most 2D games run on the **Z = 0** plane.  
This keeps movement consistent and accurate.

---

# 🟥 Step 3 — Move the Player Toward the Touch

Now, let’s move the player smoothly:

```csharp
player.position = Vector3.Lerp(
    player.position,
    pos,
    Time.deltaTime * 5f
);
```

### What is `Lerp` doing?

* Moves the player *toward* the target position
    
* Creates natural, smooth movement instead of instant teleporting
    
* `5f` controls speed (increase it for faster movement)
    

---

# ✔ Final Complete Script (Copy & Paste)

Here is the full working Unity script:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class TouchMove : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform player;

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.touchCount > 0)
        {
            Touch touch = Input.GetTouch(0);

            Vector3 pos = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(touch.position);
            pos.z = 0;

            player.position = Vector3.Lerp(
                player.position,
                pos,
                Time.deltaTime * 5f
            );
        }
    }
}
```

Attach this script to any GameObject  
➡ Set the **player** Transform in Inspector  
➡ Press Play on mobile / simulator

Your player will now follow your finger!

# 🎉 Result: Touch-to-Move Controls Are Working!

You just added:

✔ Touch detection  
✔ World-space conversion  
✔ Smooth movement  
✔ Beginner-safe code

This method is lightweight and perfect for:

* 2D platformers
    
* Top-down shooters
    
* Strategy games
    
* Endless runners
    
* Mobile prototypes

# ✨ Bonus Tips to Improve Your Touch Controls

Here are some optional upgrades you can add later:

💡 **Limit movement to x/y axis** (for side-scrollers)  
💡 Add a **movement border** (so player doesn’t go off-screen)  
💡 Add **touch hold** logic for continuous movement  
💡 Add **joystick controls** for advanced games

If you want tutorials on these — just ask!
